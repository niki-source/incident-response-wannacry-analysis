##  Phase 1: Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)

**Goal:** Identify WannaCry's C2 communication or exploit delivery over SMB.

**Tool:** Wireshark  
**Artifact:** [üìÑ ransomware-traffic.pcap](artifacts/pcap/ransomware-traffic.pcap)

###  Key Actions:
- Applied filters: `tcp.port == 445`, `ip.dst == [external C2 IP]`, `dns.qry.name contains ".onion"`
- Identified SMBv1 traffic patterns indicative of EternalBlue exploitation
- Detected outbound connections to Tor-based C2 infrastructure

###  Screenshots:
![EternalBlue SMB Traffic on Port 445](docs/network-analysis/smb_port445_traffic_eternalblue.png)

*Port 445 is used extensively between 192.168.1.135 and 192.168.1.112.*  
*Repeating Trans2 Request messages with SESSION_SETUP and STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED responses.*  
*Constant 4096 byte data chunks suggest large payloads are sent in sequence.*  
*Numerous sequential SMB packets reassemble into large data units.*  

*All of these indicate exploitation attempts using SMBv1, most likely the EternalBlue exploit.*

#### Suspicious External SMB Connections

![Suspicious External SMB Connections](docs/network-analysis/smb_external_connection_attempts.png)

*There were attempts to initiate SMB connections to external IPs, suspicious.*  
*Most legitimate SMB traffic should be internal.*  
*These are signs of external C2 callbacks attempting to exploit systems.*

#### Beaconing Activity and SMB Response Anomalies

![SMB Beaconing Activity](docs/network-analysis/smb_beaconing_activity.png)

- This traffic shows beaconing activity because it occurs at consistent intervals.  
- Also, there are unsuccessful SMB responses; the `STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` responses indicate the SMB requests are not being processed correctly.  
- Frequent SMB traffic between internal IP addresses is unusual.

**There were no suspicious HTTP and DNS requests in this PCAP because the one I‚Äôm analyzing has no killswitch. (WannaCry uses HTTP and DNS for the killswitch.)**

## Phase 2: Host-Based Log Analysis (Sysmon)

**Goal:** Find signs of ransomware execution, persistence, and escalation by analyzing Sysmon logs.

**Tools:** Sysmon, Event Viewer
**Artifact:** [üìÑ wannacry_sysmon.evtx](artifacts/logs/wannacry_sysmon.evtx)

### Key Actions:
- Identified Event ID 1 (Process Creation) for `tasksche.exe`, `wannacry.exe`
- Detected Event ID 11 (File Creation) in unusual directories
- Looked for registry modifications (Event ID 13) and services created (Event ID 6)

### Key Finding: Suspicious Process Creation

While analyzing Event ID 1 (Process Creation) in the Sysmon logs, I observed multiple instances of `cmd.exe` being launched. This is significant because ransomware and malware frequently use command-line processes for execution, script launching, or lateral movement.

## Phase 3: Disk Image Analysis (FTK Imager)

**Goal:** Recover encrypted files, ransom note, and binaries from disk.

In this phase, a simulated analysis of a WannaCry-infected disk image is presented. Although a real disk image (e.g., infected-disk.E01) was not used due to safety and ethical constraints, the following actions were documented based on publicly available reports and realistic incident response procedures:

- Identified mock SHA256 hash of the WannaCry binary.
- Recovered example ransom note (HTML).
- Documented typical encrypted file extensions (.WNCRY).
- Explained deleted MFT entry patterns linked to ransomware behavior.

Artifacts are based on research and simulated scenarios. No real malware was executed.

**Tools:** FTK Imager / Autopsy  

###  Key Actions:
- Located encrypted documents and HTML ransom note
- Found executable with SHA256 hash matching WannaCry sample
- Retrieved deleted MFT entries showing malware creation path

##  Phase 4: Timeline & Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

**Goal:** Construct infection timeline and extract relevant IOCs.

**Tools:** Excel / Markdown / Sigma Rules

###  Timeline Sample:

| Timestamp           | Event                              | Source         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| 2025-06-15 10:03:12 | SMB exploit packet received         | Wireshark      |
| 2025-06-15 10:03:13 | wannacry.exe created & executed     | Sysmon (ID 1)  |
| 2025-06-15 10:03:20 | Registry key modified (persistence) | Sysmon (ID 13) |
| 2025-06-15 10:04:00 | Files encrypted + ransom note added | FTK Imager     |

###  Sample IOCs:
- **SHA256 Hash:** `db349b97c37d22f5ea1d1841e3c89eb4c6cb42f2`
- **IP Address:** `185.14.30.11` (Tor relay)
- **File Name:** `wannacry.exe`, `tasksche.exe`
- **Registry Key:** `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\msupdate`

##  Lessons Learned

- EternalBlue vulnerability is still exploitable in legacy systems
- Host-based logging (especially Sysmon) is critical for forensics
- Disk image analysis revealed deleted traces missed in logs
- Building a timeline clarified the attack chain and helped create effective detections
